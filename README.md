# Election Audit Summary
This code can easily be used for any other election held to help determine the same metrics. So long as the CSV file formatting remains the same, the only line of code that would need to be changed is Line 9 when you load the CSV file. You could also change the name of the text file in Line 11 if you wish, otherwise the folder structure would also need to remain the same (i.e. maintaining a "resources" and "analysis" folder). If the data was for a larger election population, like for an entire state or for the country, then more repetition statements could be written to gather new metrics. This would be quite simple as there are two repetition statements already in the code to model any new repetition statement after.
